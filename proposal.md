CS Proposal
Shealagh Brown and Sam Zimpfer

For this project we want to investigate trends in UFO activity and how they have changed
overtime. We have chosen a data set about UFO sightings including their date and time,
geographic location (city, location, and longitude), shape, and duration. Using this data we will
answer three main questions: 1) Where UFO sightings are most common? 2) When did most
sightings occur? 3) How has this changed over time? We hypothesize that most sightings will
occur during summer months, as people spend more time outdoors and looking toward the sky.
We also hypothesize that UFO sightings will have become more prevalent over time, reflecting
an increase in the general public's interest in UFOâ€™s

This data is interesting because of the unknowns involving UFOs. UFOs have always
been fascinating as not much is known or has been revealed about them, making the topic even
more intriguing. Data on UFO activity could lead to profound realizations not only about the
UFOs themselves, but also about points of interest on our own planet. We hope to compare some
of our own findings from this project to the information that is made readily available to the
public and see if we are led to any new conclusions.

To answer our first question, we will create a graph of UFO occurrences at different
longitudes and one for latitude. We are also going to graph which cities have the highest reported
sightings. For our second question we are going to make a histogram of sightings per year and a
bar graph of sightings per month. To answer our 3rd question we will make a graph of small
multiples with each year being a bar graph showing sightings per month. We will also make a
small multiples graph for sighting locations during different years. We plan to use machine to
learning techniques such as linear regression to identify relationships between
longitudes/latitudes and the frequency of sightings.
